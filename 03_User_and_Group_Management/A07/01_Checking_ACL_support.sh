#The control of permissions for access to directories and files originally works as follows:
#A resource (file or directory) can only have an owner in the sense of a user and an owner group. 
#Based on these two assignments, authorizations can be assigned that only relate to reading, writing and executing. 
#A further assignment of rights can of course be applied to others, i.e. all others. Because all of this is the case, 
#it makes no sense under Linux to be a member of several security groups at the same time

#ACLs are access control lists that can contain several users and security groups in order to grant each of these 
#users and groups a set of authorizations for the respective resource.
